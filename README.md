## Cadence: Resolution

- I transformed the function in a class to be easy to run
- I added tests like the other challenge (yarn test)
- I made a function to calculate the cadence by column, that also checks the anticipation and sums the cadence based 
in it

## Winning Combinations: Resolution

- I separated the unique symbols
- Checked in a loop if they are a paying symbol
- After that I replaced all symbols that are not the current symbol I am checking to be the character X and zeroes to
 be the current symbol checking
- Then I can get all the sub arrays that have 3 or more elements
